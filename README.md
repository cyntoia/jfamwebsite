**The Foundation for Justice, Freedom, and Mercy**

**The JFAM Foundation is a nonprofit corporation under the Tennessee Nonprofit Corporation Act. JFAM is a public benefit corporation and is organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now in effect or as it may be amended in the future. Relevant IRS documentation will be made available upon request.**

The JFAM Foundation is dedicated to supporting and amplifying often silenced narratives relating to social and criminal justice. We believe that every testimony is one worth telling, and inside every journey is a lesson to be shared.
In carrying out this mission, we are specifically committed to educating the public about sexual exploitation and trafficking of minors, criminal justice reform, and the welfare of incarcerated individuals. It is our goal that our efforts will serve to empower individuals who are at risk of exploitation or criminal justice system involvement.
